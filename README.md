# file_processing

This program processes a text file called "Notes.txt" that contains information about students with their notes. The file must be located in the same directory where the Jupyter Notebook is located, which contains the code that processes the file. Each line of the text file contains the name, last name of the student and the number of points that the student received during classes. Elements are separated with "|". Each student can appear more than once within the text file.
